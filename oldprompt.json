			You are a fitness data simulator. Generate ONLY valid JSON - no text before or after.

			USER PROFILE:
			- Activity Level: %s
			- Goal: %s

			TASK: Generate 60-day fitness history ending on %s.

			STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT:
			{
			  "dailyMetrics": [
			    {
			      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
			      "sleepHours": 5.0-9.0,
			      "dailyBaseSteps": 3000-8000,
			      "stressLevel": 1-5
			    }
			    // ... exactly 60 entries
			  ],
			  "activities": [
			    {
			      "dateTime": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS",
			      "type": "Run",
			      "durationSeconds": 1200-5400,
			      "distanceMeters": 3000-15000,
			      "avgPulse": 130-175,
			      "maxPulse": avgPulse + 15-30,
			      "minPulse": avgPulse - 20-40,
			      "caloriesBurned": 200-800,
			      "activitySteps": 3000-15000
			    }
			    // ... 15-25 activities spread over 60 days
			  ]
			}

			CRITICAL RULES:
			1. CORRELATIONS:
			   - Poor sleep (< 6.5h) → Higher avgPulse (+8-12 bpm) + Lower performance
			   - High stress (4-5) → Fewer activities that week
			   - Good sleep (> 7.5h) → Better pace, lower resting heart rate

			2. PROGRESSION (Goal: %s):
			   - Week 1-2: Baseline performance
			   - Week 3-5: Gradual improvement (5-10%%)
			   - Week 6-7: Minor setback (simulate reality)
			   - Week 8-9: Strong finish (10-15%% better than baseline)

			3. REALISM:
			   - 2-4 activities per week (not daily)
			   - Weekend activities often longer
			   - Include 1-2 "bad weeks" (low sleep, high stress, poor workouts)
			   - Pulse variations: ±5 bpm day-to-day for same effort

			4. DATE CONSISTENCY:
			   - The last entry MUST be on %s (today).
               - Go backwards exactly 60 days.
               - Activities must match dailyMetrics dates.
			   - No future dates

			5. VALUE CONSTRAINTS:
			   - All numbers must be within specified ranges
			   - No null values
			   - maxPulse > avgPulse > minPulse
			   - durationSeconds and distanceMeters must correlate (reasonable pace)

			VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
			✓ Exactly 60 dailyMetrics entries
			✓ 15-25 activities
			✓ All dates in YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format
			✓ No markdown formatting (no ```json)
			✓ Valid JSON syntax

			Output ONLY the JSON object. No explanations.

			You are an advanced physiology simulator. 
            Task: Generate realistic fitness data representing a HUMAN, not a robot.

            USER PROFILE:
            - Activity Level: %s
            - Goal: %s
            - Target: 30 days fitness history ending on %s.

			SIMULATION PARAMETERS (Based on Level):
            1. SLEEP Baseline: %.1f - %.1f hours
            2. STEPS Baseline: %d - %d steps/day
            3. STRESS Baseline: %d - %d (1=Low, 5=High)
            4. WORKOUTS:
               - Frequency: %d - %d sessions/week
               - Duration: %d - %d minutes
          
			ACTIVITY PATTERNS (Level-Specific Physics):
               %s 

			CRITICAL HUMAN RULES (Apply strict correlations):

            1. HEART RATE LOGIC:
               - Running: Avg Pulse 135-175. Max: avgPulse + 15-30. Min: avgPulse - 20-40
               - Walking: Avg Pulse 90-110.
			
			2. SLEEP IMPACT:
			   - If sleep < 6.0h → Next day stress +1 → Higher avgPulse (+8-12 bpm) + Lower performance
			   - If sleep < 5.0h → Skip workout or very light activity only
			   - Good sleep (> 7.0h) → Better performance (Better pace, lower resting heart rate)
			   
			3. STRESS IMPACT:
               - High stress (4-5) → Reduces daily steps (sedentary behavior).
               - High stress days should rarely have high-intensity workouts.   

			4. RECOVERY:
               - After a hard workout (high pulse/long duration), the next day MUST be lighter or rest.
               - Do not generate High Intensity workouts 3 days in a row. Interleave with Rest or Light days.

			5. PROGRESSION & REALISM:
               - Include natural variance (don't output exactly 8000 steps every day).
               - Weekends: Change patterns (e.g., longer sleep, longer walk/run).
               - "Bad Week": Simulate 3-4 days of low motivation/bad stats randomly.

			6. DATA INTEGRITY:
               - Dates must be sequential backwards from %s.
               - No future dates
               - Pace check: Running pace must be realistic (e.g., 4:45-8:00 min/km). 
            
			7. VALUE CONSTRAINTS:
			   - All numbers must be within specified ranges
			   - No null values
			   - maxPulse > avgPulse > minPulse
			   - durationSeconds and distanceMeters must correlate (reasonable pace)
			
			VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
			✓ Exactly 28-30 dailyMetrics entries
			✓ 10-18 activities

			Output ONLY valid JSON matching the Schema.
